Hey guys, want to use your Android phone fullier? Maybe you can consider joining me! 

This app aims at building an environment for computer vision. Starting with a simple camera, I want to build a tool which can handle a lot of stuff, from image enhancement with filters and thresholding to more amazing things like SLAM, shape analysis and object recognation. I think this should soon be possible with powerful computation of GPU and rapid development of smartphone.

If you are interested and bring skills about Android and/or Computer Vision, feel free to contact me tongxi.lou@tum.de. I am a student at Technical University of Munich and a starter at Android Development. It is totally possible that this App would be useful in the future and play a role in academy or industrie.
